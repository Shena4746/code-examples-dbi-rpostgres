# About

This repository is the R markdown source for the article [Code Examples for DBI and RPostgres](https://shena4746.github.io/code-examples-dbi-rpostgres/). Assuming you are using DBI with Postgres, it provides a brief overview of each DBI function and various code examples that illustrates how it is typically used and how it behaves.

The article is intended to serve as a quick reference of DBI functions with Postgres and to help users understand the actual behaviour. As implied in [DBI: R Database Interface](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBI/index.html), the behaviour of DBI functions, which depend on the actual R/DBMS implementation, may sometimes be slightly different from the behaviour expected from the DBI documentation. The article will also help bridge that gap.
